# 🖥️ Object-Oriented Analysis & Design - Chapter 2: Give Them What They Want

## 📌 Overview
This chapter emphasizes the importance of understanding customer needs when designing software. Through use cases, gathering requirements, and refining system behaviors, developers ensure that software aligns with customer expectations and functions as intended.

## 🐶 Task: Designing a Dog Door System
### 🏗️ Components:
- **🚪 Dog Door Class**: Controls the mechanism of the dog door.
- **🎛️ Remote Class**: Enables remote operation of the dog door.

### ⚠️ Problem:
The initial system allowed unintended access (rabbits and rats 🐇🐀), requiring users to manually close the door using the remote. This did not align with customer expectations.

## 📋 Understanding Requirements
- **👂 Listen to customers** to design a system that meets their needs.
- **✅ A requirement** is a specific functionality that the system must perform.
- **🖥️ A system** is the complete application or project being developed.
- **📌 Good requirements** ensure that a system operates correctly and efficiently.

### 🔑 Key Takeaways on Requirements:
- The best way to gather good requirements is by **understanding what the system is supposed to do**.
- Developers should **know the system better than the customers** to anticipate and solve potential problems.

## 📝 Gathering Requirements Through Use Cases
### 📖 Definition:
- **📌 A use case** describes how the system interacts with users to achieve a goal.
- It captures system requirements in a way that is easy to understand.
- Each use case should be customer-focused rather than code-focused.

### 🎯 Three Essential Parts of a Use Case:
1. **💡 Clear Value**: The use case must provide tangible benefits to the customer.
2. **🔄 Start and Stop Conditions**: Define when the use case begins and ends.
3. **🎭 External Initiator**: The event or actor that starts the use case (e.g., a user action or another system interaction).

### 📌 Important Notes:
- **✔️ One use case = One goal.**
- **📖 Use cases should be simple and easy for customers to understand.**
- **🖼️ Use case ≠ Use case diagram.** A use case is a list of steps, while a use case diagram visually represents these steps.

## 📚 Important Terminology:
| 🏷️ Term | 📖 Definition |
|------|------------|
| **🎭 External Initiator** | Triggers a use case (e.g., user or another system). |
| **📌 Use Case** | Helps define good requirements by showing what the system does. |
| **🚀 Start Condition** | The event that begins a use case. |
| **✅ Requirement** | Something the system needs to succeed. |
| **💡 Clear Value** | Ensures the use case is beneficial. |
| **🛑 Stop Condition** | Defines when a use case ends. |
| **🛤️ Main Path** | The default flow when everything goes as expected. |

## 🏆 Summary: Why OOA&D Matters
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA&D) is essential for writing effective software. This chapter highlights tools that ensure applications meet customer expectations by refining requirements and designing comprehensive use cases.

### 📝 Key Takeaways:
- Good requirements **align system behavior with customer expectations**. ✅
- **📋 Use cases help uncover hidden or missing requirements**. 🔍
- A well-structured use case includes **alternative paths** to handle unexpected scenarios. 🔄

By following these principles, developers can create software that truly meets user needs and delivers a seamless experience. 🚀
